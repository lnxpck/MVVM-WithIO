# MVVM-WithIO

This simple app displays a list of the most starred repositories on GitHub by a language. 
User can choose a language to filter repositories and select repository in the list to open it in the SFSafariViewController.

Inspired from Uptech's project : https://github.com/uptechteam/Coordinator-MVVM-Rx-Example

Add my own approach by adopt the functional input-output approach to view models inspired by [Kickstarter](https://github.com/kickstarter/native-docs/blob/master/inputs-outputs.md)
